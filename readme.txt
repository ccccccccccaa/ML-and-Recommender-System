The primary implementation for this assignment is contained within the Jupyter Notebook file: Assignment3_framework.ipynb.

To execute the code and see the results for all five implemented methods, please follow these steps:

Ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn).
Open the Assignment3_framework.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment.
To run the entire notebook and generate all outputs, please use the "Restart & Run All" command from the main menu (Kernel -> Restart & Run All).

Wait for the execution to complete. All data will be printed and graphs will be displayed in the notebook's output cells. Each method's final MAE and RMSE scores will be printed in its respective section.
